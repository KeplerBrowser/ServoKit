# ServoKit docs

ServoKit lets you embed Servo in your own app, with the platform's own web
view as a compatibility layer where Servo isn't ready yet. These docs explain
how to try it, how it works, and how to use it on each platform.

New here? Read [Get started](getting-started.md), then
[How ServoKit works](../ARCHITECTURE.md).
