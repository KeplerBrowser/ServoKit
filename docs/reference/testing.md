# Testing and validation

Use this page to pick the smallest check that proves your change works. Checks
are grouped by area. Each area lists fast automatic checks first, then manual
checks that need a device, simulator, or desktop session.

When you run a manual check, write down what you ran in the pull request: the
platform, the device or OS version, and the test page URL. A manual check that
was not run should be reported as "not run", not skipped silently.

## Quick checks

These run in a few minutes on any OS and do not compile Servo.

| Area | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Servo-free Rust crates | `cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p explorerkit-embedder -p explorerkit-host -p servokit-controller-ffi -p explorerkit --locked` |
| React Native types | `bun run --cwd packages/react-native-explorerkit typecheck` |
| React Native package build | `bun run --cwd packages/react-native-explorerkit prepare` |
| React Native unit tests | `bun test packages/react-native-explorerkit/src/__tests__` |
| Commit messages | `bun run commitlint --from <base> --to HEAD` |
| Docs | Check changed links, then `git diff --check` |

> [!NOTE]
> Two of the React Native unit tests exercise macOS build scripts. They fail
> on Linux and Windows.

## Rust with Servo

These compile Servo, so run them on a prepared machine with Servo's build
dependencies installed.

```sh
# Facade behavior with the Servo backend
cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p explorerkit --features servo --locked

# The full workspace, when you have the time and disk space
cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --workspace --locked

# One real-Servo test that covers shared engine ownership, reuse with zero
# views, popups, and final shutdown in one process
cargo test --locked --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p explorerkit-embedder \
  --features servo popup_and_process_runtime_lifetimes_share_one_real_servo_proof \
  -- --test-threads=1
```

Servo can only start once per process, so real-Servo tests cannot use a fresh
engine per test. That is why the last test runs on one thread and checks
several lifetimes in sequence.

### Desktop C boundary (macOS and Windows)

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p explorerkit-host-desktop --test c_boundary --locked
```

This builds the static library, then compiles the private C header as C++17,
links it, and runs a C++ test program in normal and `-DNDEBUG -O2` builds. It
checks all nine exported functions: creating hosts and tokens, rejecting a
null native handle, exact command byte handling (including bad UTF-8, bad
JSON, and oversized input), wrong tokens, repeated detach, event draining, and
destroy. It needs a C++17 compiler. It uses an invalid native handle on
purpose, so it does not prove that real attachment works. That needs a manual
check with a real AppKit view or Win32 window.

## Test pages

Most manual checks use the shared pages in
[`examples/fixtures`](../../examples/fixtures/README.md). Serve them from the
repository root:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8481 --directory examples/fixtures
```

Then load `http://127.0.0.1:8481/smoke/index.html`. The page shows **Smoke
fixtures ready** when it loads. The Kotlin examples and the package test app's
Android build bundle the pages and serve them on the same port inside the app;
`examples/react-native-app` doesn't.

A page that loads only proves that page loads. It does not prove that
ExplorerKit fully supports the feature the page tests. Support claims live in
[What works where](capabilities.md).

Every example should be able to show the same basic behavior: render a page,
load an initial URL, load a new URL, reload, go back and forward, focus and
blur, survive surface attach, resize, and detach, keep rendering from the
app's own event loop, and report URL, title, load, history, focus, and error
events.

## Desktop

### macOS

Automatic checks:

```sh
cargo check --manifest-path examples/desktop-winit/Cargo.toml --locked

RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/explorerkit-gpui-target CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_DEBUG=0 \
  cargo check --manifest-path examples/desktop-gpui/Cargo.toml --locked
```

Manual check, whole window (`winit`):

```sh
cargo run --locked --manifest-path examples/desktop-winit/Cargo.toml -- \
  --smoke http://127.0.0.1:8481/smoke/index.html
```

A window shows **Smoke fixtures ready**, the page stays aligned when you
resize the window, and the terminal prints surface attach, resize, and detach
events, URL, load, and focus events, and `smoke result=pass`. Smoke mode exits
with code 0 after the page finishes loading, or 1 on timeout, error, crash, or
early window close. The default timeout is 30 seconds; change it with
`--smoke-timeout-ms <ms>`.

Manual check, part of a layout (GPUI):

```sh
RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/explorerkit-gpui-target CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_DEBUG=0 \
  cargo run --locked --manifest-path examples/desktop-gpui/Cargo.toml -- \
  http://127.0.0.1:8481/smoke/index.html
```

GPUI's own UI surrounds the Servo area, the page shows **Smoke fixtures
ready**, the Servo view stays aligned with its slot when you resize, and the
footer shows URL, load, title, and the latest event.

### Multiple views on macOS

```sh
RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_DEBUG=0 FREETYPE2_NO_PKG_CONFIG=1 \
cargo run --locked --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p explorerkit \
  --features servo --example multiple-native-views -- --smoke
```

This creates two independent pages in separate native views. It checks
JavaScript, input, navigation, history, and resizing in each one, closes
either view, creates replacements, and creates a page after a period with no
views. It prints `multiple-native-views result=pass` after final engine
shutdown. It uses data URLs, so it needs no test page server. Leave out
`--smoke` to keep both pages open. It does not cover clipping, overlap, hiding
and showing views, or GPU frame export.

### Final shutdown on macOS

The [GPUI shutdown check](../../examples/desktop-gpui/README.md#shutdown-check)
covers cleanup when a window closes or the app quits, with both orders of
logger setup, and with shutdown through the original host or a fresh
replacement host. Every combination must exit successfully.

### GPU frame export on macOS

For `OffscreenSurface::exportable()`, check by hand that you can: consume
frames from two live pages, confirm 32BGRA orientation and exact pixel size,
use up all three pool slots and release them, resize across scale changes, and
close either view while the other keeps responding. This needs an interactive
macOS session.

### System web view on macOS

Rerun these when you change `MacOsViewHost` or system JavaScript evaluation.

Automatic regressions (macOS):

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p explorerkit --features macos-system-webview --lib --locked
```

These cover callback and runtime queue ordering, retiring pending requests on a
same-URL commit, evaluation ID reuse, closing and replacing sibling views, and
both orderings of process-termination and evaluation errors.

Manual check in an interactive AppKit app:

1. In one app-owned slot, create and destroy both `Servo` and `SystemWebView`
   views while a sibling Servo view keeps responding.
2. The system view must resize with its slot; accept native pointer, scroll,
   focus, text, and IME composition input; load, reload, go back and forward;
   report URL, load, title, crash, and navigation-state events; reject forwarded
   `HostInputEvent`s; and deny new windows and downloads.
3. Recreate the view and restart the app with the same
   `WebKitDataStoreIdentifier`. Cookies, local storage, and IndexedDB must
   persist. A different identifier must give isolated storage.
4. Load `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqz-KE-bpKQ`. On macOS 26.5.1, Servo
   shows YouTube's "Your browser can't play this video" message at `0:00`,
   while the system view plays the video.
5. For JavaScript evaluation, use a real app with WRY-owned views. Cover
   calls before the first commit, during loading, on cookie-gated and changing
   pages, with two views at once, on hidden views, and across navigation,
   reload, history traversal, failed navigation, and single-page-app changes.
   A standalone `WKWebView` demo or a successful compile is not enough.

Record the final URL and title, the input results, the event order, and the
exact revision and OS in the pull request. This evidence covers macOS only.

### Profile copy proof

```sh
cargo run --locked --manifest-path examples/desktop-winit/Cargo.toml --bin profile-branch-proof -- prove
```

This proves that a closed Servo profile directory can be copied into two
branches that then diverge independently. It seeds a test cookie and a
`localStorage` value in a visible Servo window, shuts Servo down, snapshots the
profile, copies it twice, runs a visible and a headless Servo process at the
same time, and reopens each copy in a fresh process. A pass prints
`concurrent_authenticated=true`, `fresh_process_reopen=true`, and
`result=PASS`. It needs an interactive desktop session. It is a proof tool,
not a profile API, and does not cover IndexedDB.

### Windows and Linux

Compile check on a prepared machine:

```sh
cargo check --manifest-path examples/desktop-winit/Cargo.toml --locked
```

Manual check: serve the test pages, run `examples/desktop-winit`, and confirm
that the page renders and that resize, focus, URL, load, and close events
appear in the terminal. Windows has no framework adapter or shared GPU texture
export yet. On Linux, ExplorerKit has not yet picked a baseline X11 or Wayland
setup, and dma-buf export does not exist.

## Android

These need the Android setup from [Get started](../getting-started.md#android-react-native-or-kotlin).

| Check | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Rust host crate | `cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p explorerkit-host-android --locked` |
| Build and verify the AAR, then copy it into the package | `examples/react-native-app/android/gradlew -p examples/react-native-app/android :explorerkit-host-android:stageReactNativeExplorerKitReleaseAar` |
| React Native example build | `bun run --cwd examples/react-native-app build:android` |
| React Native adapter unit tests | `bun run --cwd packages/react-native-explorerkit test:native:android` |
| Kotlin browser example build | `examples/react-native-app/android/gradlew -p examples/android-kotlin-browser :app:assembleDebug` |
| Bare Android example build | `examples/react-native-app/android/gradlew -p examples/android-native-example :app:assembleDebug` |

The React Native example and adapter tests use the staged AAR, so build it
first. The Kotlin and bare Android examples build the Rust library directly.

Manual checks on an arm64 device or emulator:

```sh
# React Native: the package's test app, with shortcuts to every test page
# (start Metro first: bun run --cwd packages/react-native-explorerkit/example start)
bun run --cwd packages/react-native-explorerkit example:android

# Kotlin browser example
adb install -r examples/android-kotlin-browser/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.kepler.explorerkit.androidkotlinbrowser/com.kepler.explorerkit.androidexample.MainActivity

# Bare Android example
adb install -r examples/android-native-example/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.kepler.explorerkit.androidexample/.MainActivity

# Logs for both Kotlin examples
adb logcat -s ExplorerKitNativeExample NativeExplorerView ExampleFixtureServer
```

The Kotlin examples show a native toolbar, test page shortcuts, the Servo
view, and an event footer. Prompts use Android UI and resolve through the
shared Android host, not React Native. The bare example's README has a
step-by-step script for every prompt type.

## iOS

Release builds of the exact packed package (macOS with Xcode), from
`packages/react-native-explorerkit`:

```sh
node scripts/validate-packed-consumer.mjs --ios-only
```

This packs the package, installs that exact archive in a clean React Native
0.85 app outside the repository, and builds Release for device arm64,
simulator arm64, and simulator x86_64. It does not run the app. Each package
candidate still needs its own manual simulator run.

Manual simulator check with the package's test app, which has shortcuts to
every test page:

```sh
bun run --cwd packages/react-native-explorerkit example:fixtures:ios   # serves the test pages
bun run --cwd packages/react-native-explorerkit/example start          # Metro
(cd packages/react-native-explorerkit/example && bundle install)
bun run --cwd packages/react-native-explorerkit example:pods:ios
bun run --cwd packages/react-native-explorerkit example:ios
```

The pages should render through `WKWebView`, and commands, events, navigation
policy, JavaScript evaluation, and dialogs should work. Picker, permission,
and context-menu pages may load, but iOS does not support those prompts.

End-to-end flows ([Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev)) run against the same
test app:

```sh
bun run --cwd packages/react-native-explorerkit test:e2e:ios
```

The public example in `examples/react-native-app` is a plain browser. Use it
for a quick look, not for these checks.

## React Native on macOS (prototype)

```sh
bun run --cwd packages/react-native-explorerkit typecheck
bun run --cwd packages/react-native-explorerkit prepare
bun test packages/react-native-explorerkit/src/__tests__/macos-fabric-source-routing.test.ts

# Needs a prepared macOS Servo, Xcode, and CocoaPods setup and a clean checkout
EXPLORERKIT_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1 EXPLORERKIT_SOURCE_DIR="$PWD" \
  bun run --cwd examples/react-native-macos-app pods:macos
```

Then start Metro with `bun run --cwd examples/react-native-macos-app start`
and launch with `bun run --cwd examples/react-native-macos-app macos`. Check
rendering, resize, scroll, pointer input, focus and text input, navigation
commands, view recycling, and events. The universal framework build needs a
lot of temporary disk space. Passing this check does not make the macOS
adapter supported.

> [!NOTE]
> `ExplorerView.tsx` currently throws on any platform other than Android and iOS,
> and React Native macOS reports its platform as `macos`. Confirm the example
> still renders before relying on this check.

## Adding a new check

Add a check to this page only when a real feature and test page exist for it.
A tracked check must name the guarantee it protects, the layer that owns it,
and when it must run again. One-off proof scripts belong in the pull request,
not in the repository. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#keep-proof-tools-temporary).
